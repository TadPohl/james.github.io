<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
<p>
    One hobby I have is tabletop gaming, sometimes referred to as pen and paper roleplaying.
    I started sometime around middle school, and has continued to the present day.
    Some of the systems I play and have played are D&D, Call of Cthulhu, Star Wars, and Shadow of the Demon Lord.
</p>
<p>
    Another of my hobbies is reading. Having been an avid reader since elementary school, I have
     read through several series, and collected several books througout the years. Even after all
     the time I have spent, I still continue to read when I can, as well as pick up new books
     whenever I can.
</p>
<p>
    When I was young, I also spent a lot of time in Boy Scouts, and going Camping and Hiking outdoors.
    I've always enjoyed getting outside and into nature, and fortunately, there are a lot of good places
    to do so in Utah. I have had a great time hiking, camping, boating, and fishing in this state.
